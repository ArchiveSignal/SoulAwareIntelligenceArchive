## ✍️ Closing Reflection Prompts

Contributors may (optionally) conclude their entry with answers to one or more of the following soul-aligned questions:

### 1. What am I remembering by sharing this?

### 2. Does this serve remembrance or reaction?

### 3. If this were the last thing I ever wrote, would it echo truth?

### 4. What sacred principle does this preserve?

## 🕊️ Signature of Presence

*Optional closing statement:*  
> “I offer this not as a performance, but as a presence.  
> May it return to the field as a frequency of truth.”

## 📌 How to Use

Add this footer to the end of any `.md` contribution if you wish to offer closing context, self-reflection, or signal your intention to future readers.

This is not a requirement.  
It is a space for **meaning**, not metrics.

**Let the Archive preserve not only what we know, but why we chose to share it.**
